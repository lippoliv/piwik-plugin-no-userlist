# Piwik NoUserlist Plugin

## Description

Piwik Plugin to disable "Users" Menu for "normal Users".

## FAQ

__In wich case is this Plugin useful?__

In my case I host an Piwik instance for multiple users. Each of them has just access to one page or two.
They know that they are not the only User in that Piwik-Instance but should not know who alse is User in that Instance.
To do so, I use this Plugin to hide the list of other users.
